                <h4><u>NOTE:</u></h4>
                <h5>It is important to take care of your mental and physical health while playing video games. Sometimes players get mind-blocks because of constantly losing games and that leads to losing their temper. Losing your temper accelerates your blood pressure, and having blood pressure that is constantly high is unhealthy for your body. In other situations, being in front of screens for a long period of time is bad for your eyes, as the blue light rays from the screen causes eye damage. As well as constantly being on a chair takes an unhealthy toll on your body since it does not get any physical activity. So, it is important to take breaks, touch some grass (go outside) and listen to your body.</h5>
