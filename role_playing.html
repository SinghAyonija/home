Instead of turn-based or menu-based fighting, real-time combat is prioritized in the games, where the player controls the characters directly. These games frequently employ hack-and-slash or shooter-style action game combat systems. Action adventure games with a mission structure and role-playing game principles can also be included in the action role-playing games.</td>
